# Spring-boot-Flask-Microservices-communication-Project

This project demonstrates how two independent services, one developed in Java (Spring Boot) and the other in Python (Flask), can effectively communicate via REST APIs. It showcases cross-language interoperability in a microservices architecture, a common pattern in modern distributed systems.

The services are Dockerised and run in isolated containers, simulating a real-world environment where applications written in different languages need to collaborate seamlessly.


ðŸ”§ Key Features
Spring Boot service exposes REST endpoints and handles Java-based business logic.

Flask service consumes Spring Boot APIs and handles Python-based logic.

Docker is used to containerise both applications for consistent local development and deployment.

Clear focus on modularity, separation of concerns, and scalability.
